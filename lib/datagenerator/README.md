# RESO Common Format Data Generator

Generates data for one or more resources in RESO Common Format, including support for nested and related records.

# Single Resource Data Generation

In some cases, like generating individual Property, Member, Office, or OpenHouse records, simulated data might be sufficient without the need for other resources.

# Multiple Resource Data Generation

The common case is to generate data for related resources, such as Property with its related Member, Office, OpenHouse, and Media data.

These can be generated by calling the code generator as follows:

```
$ reso-certification-utils datagenerator -p <pathToMetadataReport> -r Property,Member -o testData
```

Where:

- `-p` is a path to the metadata report. Defaults to the RESO DD 2.0 metadata report.
- `-r` is a list of resources to generate data for. If not specified, then the entire report is used.
- `-x` if true, nest data into the records, otherwise create related records at the top level.
- `-o` the output path to write files to, if needed.

# Usage as a Library

For examples on how to use the data generator as a library, see the [tests for this functionality](/test/datagenerator.js).
